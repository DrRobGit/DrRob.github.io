            <h2>About Dr. Rob Tutoring</h2>
            <p>
                This website is a project. It was started in winter 24-25 by me, Dr. Rob, as an idea to use a website to provide homeworks, exams, and solutions to them to anyone who wants to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                A significant problem existed though, I had no idea how to make a website and didn't like the look of or idea of using website builder programs. I also didn't have any homeworks, exams, solutions, or lessons typed up or made. So I set out to learn how to write html, css, and javascript to make the website. I figured that once I have a website, I will be able to start adding things to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why it is a work in progress. At the time of writing this page, in June of 2025, I just learned the barest of basics on html and haven't learned CSS yet so there is no styling whatsoever on any pages.
