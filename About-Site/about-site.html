            <h2>About Dr. Rob Tutoring</h2>
            <p>
                This website is a project. It was started in winter 24-25 by Dr. Rob as merely an idea. The idea was to use a website to provide homeworks, exams, and solutions to them to anyone who wants to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                A significant problem existed though, he had no idea how to make a website and didn't like the look of or idea of using website builder programs. So he set out to learn how to write html, css, and javascript to make the website as he envisioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why it is a work in progress. Everything on the website is made by Dr. Rob and at the time of writing this page, in June of 2025, he just learned the barest of basics on html and hasn't learned CSS yet so there is no styling whatsoever on any pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current intention is to release updates to the site twice a year. Here is an idea of what updates could include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>New courses</li>
                <li>New information for existing courses</li>
                <li>New additions to the knowledge bank</li>
                <li>Entire redos of the website</li>
                <li>Fun stuff like game or show reviews, just like the good days of the internet.</li>
                <li>Too many other possibilities to mention</li>
            </ul>
