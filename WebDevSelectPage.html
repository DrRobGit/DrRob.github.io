            This page exists to give you a choice of either the construction junction, or the historical records sections. In the future, there will be a drop down menu and you will be able to select from there, but I don't know how to make that yet so this is the way we are going to get that done.

            The <a href="/Historical-Record/HR-Home.html">Historical Records</a> page offers a look back at previous versions of the website. Each will be dated by it's publication date and it's out-of commission date. This is my way of documenting my progress in learning how to make a website.

            In order to keep a file system somewhat organized, you should have an expectation that not all links will work. In particular, this sections links will not work on historical versions of the site. That would probably result in a ridiculous amount of files and I don't have the organizational skills for that kind of nonsense.

            The <a href="Construction-Junction/CJ-Home.html">Construnction Junction</a> page offers a look into what I am currently working on. It's where I will be testing out new things that I am either learning or trying out for the website. Expect it to look messy and not always work like you might think.
