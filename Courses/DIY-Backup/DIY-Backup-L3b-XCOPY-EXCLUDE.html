                Lesson 10 -
                <code>ROBOCOPY</code> Options Part 6: Job Options
            </h2>
            <img class="printout" src="images/Job-options.png" />

            <p>
                This set of options isn't strictly necessary for our back program goal, but it might prove useful for something you have in mind so we will show it off a bit. It also eases us in a little to working with files and not directly in the command prompt.
            </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Use <code>/QUIT</code> to view the options</h3>
                <p>
                    We start with this one, not because of it's utility, but because it is easy. Run <code>ROBOCOPY</code> like you normally would, but use <code>/QUIT</code> in addition to whatever other options you like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing that prints out is the input section. The idea here is you get a change to view the inputs as <code>ROBOCOPY</code> understands them to make sure they are what you are expecting them to be. Pretty straightforward.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Store Inputs in a file with <code>/SAVE</code> and <code>/JOB</code></h3>
                <p>
                    The other two options we are going to cover are the <code>/SAVE</code> and the <code>/JOB</code> options. These options allow you to save and make use of saved options and other inputs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe you're tired of having to type all these options in all the time. Then save them! To see this in action, run an option filled command for <code>ROBOCOPY</code> like
                </p>
                <kbd>ROBOCOPY "C:\Users\Rob\Desktop\Original" "C:\Users\Rob\Desktop\Backup" /E /J /R:5 /W:10 /TEE /LOG:"C:\Users\Rob\Desktop\BackupLog.txt" /SAVE:"C:\Users\Rob\Desktop\JobData.rcj"</kbd>
                <p>
                    In the above command, we have included the option to save the options to a file called "JobData.rcj" located on the desktop using the option
                </p>
                <kbd>/SAVE:"C:\Users\Rob\Desktop\JobData.rcj"</kbd>
                <p>
                    The ".rcj" extension probably stands for RoboCopy Job, but I don't want to look it up. It's a nice thought and I don't want it spoiled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open the file and have a look inside. It quite a bit of interesting features going on. 
                </p>
